# Fractals

### Tasks

* Large images are taking a while to generate (8K image at 10000 iterations took 20 minutes). Need to look into optimization
* Need to add color smoothing. There is very noticable banding. Need to implement logarithmic smoothing to mandlebrot function

### Sample images
These images are genearated using the code found in the "with_hsv" branch of this project. All samples are .jpeg as the generated bitmaps are huge.

Hue[0,60], saturation 100%, value 100%

Hue[220,260], saturation 100%, value 100%. Gradually zooming in
